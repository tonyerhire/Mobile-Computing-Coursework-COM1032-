app name-distance,route and time  between points  on a map

My app finds the distance , time between two defined points on a map and displays the route through a map fragment and saves them to a database.
When both points are entered in the edit text field and findpath is clicked the distance ,time are showed in textview and map is
shown in fragment.I also made use of services and asynctask.

When i was making my database i encourtered a column id not found error although my database saved sucessfully.
